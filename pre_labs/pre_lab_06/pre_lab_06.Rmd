## Points to hit

1.  Review of fifth lab questions/problems.
2.  Demonstration of PDF parsing with Tabula

### Task 1: Load libraries

**Task** Run the following code in the gray-colored codeblock below -- not in the console -- to load the tidyverse library. To run the code, click the little green play button (left facing arrow) at the top right of the codeblock. In Rmarkdown data notebooks, we write code inside of codeblocks, and explanatory text in the white area outside of it.

```{r}
# turn off sci notation
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
```

## PDF Parsing with Tabula

Tabula works best when tables in PDFs are clearly defined and have nicely-formatted information. Here's a perfect example: [active voters by county in Maryland](https://elections.maryland.gov/press_room/2024_stats/Eligible%20Active%20Voters%20by%20County%20-%20PP24.pdf).

### Task 1: Download and Install Tabula

**Task**: [Download and install Tabula](https://tabula.technology/). Tabula works much the same way as Open Refine does -- it works in the browser by spinning up a small webserver in your computer. Start it as you would any other desktop application, then go to <http://127.0.0.1:8080/> in your browser.

When Tabula opens, you click browse to find the PDF on your computer somewhere, and then click import. After it imports, click autodetect tables. You'll see red boxes appear around what Tabula believes are the tables. You'll see it does a pretty good job at this.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/md_voters.png"))
```

ow you can hit the green "Preview & Export Extracted Data" button on the top right. You should see something very like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/md_voters2.png"))
```

You can now export that extracted table to a CSV file using the "Export" button. Put it in your pre_lab_06 folder. And then we can read it into R:

### Task 2: Load data

**Task** Load the Maryland voters by county data by running the following codeblock.

```{r}
voters_by_county <- read_csv("tabula-Eligible Active Voters by County - PP24.csv")
View(voters_by_county)
```

Boom - we're good to go: a nice, tidy dataframe.

## When it looks good, but needs a little fixing

Here's a slightly more involved PDF: precinct-level election results from [Benzie County, Michigan's 2024 primary election](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RqqFInF-5Mb_STYPowPQJSEh9qXh-fpZ/view?usp=drive_link).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/benzie_1.png"))
```

### Task 3: Get it into Tabula

**Task** Save the PDF and import to Tabula

Looks like a spreadsheet, right? Save that PDF file to your computer in a place where you'll remember it (like a Downloads folder).

Now let's repeat the steps we did to import the PDF into Tabula, but don't autodetect the tables. It should look like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/benzie_2.png"))
```

### Task 4: Draw a Box

**Task** Using your cursor, draw a box across the first table so it looks like the image below.

This is pretty good, but we want to capture the second line of the headers - `Voters`, `Cast` and `Turnout` - and for our purposes we only want the first page of the PDF for now. So hit "Clear All Selections" button at the top and let's draw a box around what we want. Using your cursor, click and drag a box across the first page so it looks like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/benzie_3.png"))
```

Now you can hit the green "Preview & Export Extracted Data" button on the top right. Using the "Stream" method, you should see something very like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/benzie_4.png"))
```

You can now export that extracted table to a CSV file using the "Export" button. And then we can read it into R and add column names and some other things:

### Task 5: Export the CSV file

**Task** Export the CSV file to your pre_lab_06 folder and read it into R by running the following codeblock. What problems do you see with the data? **Answer**

```{r}
benzie_2024 <- read_csv("tabula-Benzie Aug 6,2024 Official Precinct Results.csv")

benzie_2024
```

## Cleaning up the data in R

The good news is that we have data we don't have to retype. The bad news is, it's hardly in importable shape. We have a few things to fix. The first one is that there's no header row, so we should add at least a place-holder. We can do that by importing it again, but with a twist.

Then we've got rows with NAs, plus office names mixed up with candidate names. Let's start by re-importing it with a header row and ditching rows where the second column is NA, then renaming the first column to `candidate`:

### Task 6: Cleaning up & getting rid of rows we don't need

**Task** Get rid of rows we don't need by running the codeblock below. What problems remain? **Answer**

```{r}
benzie_2024 <- read_csv("tabula-Benzie Aug 6,2024 Official Precinct Results.csv", col_names = FALSE)

benzie_2024 <- benzie_2024 |>
  filter(!is.na(X2)) |> 
  rename(candidate = X1)

benzie_2024
```

Ok, now we have numbers and candidates, but we still need better headers and a way to split the candidate column to extract the party value. Let's split the party values out and add some headers with precinct and vote type information, plus a few office names based on the candidate.

### Task 7: Making a party column, changing headers and adding an office column.

**Task** Run the codeblock below. What changed, and what issues or problems remain? **Answer**

```{r}
benzie_2024 <- benzie_2024 |>
  separate(candidate, c("candidate", "party"), sep=' - ') |> 
  rename(`Almira ED` = X2, `Almira EV` = X3, `Almira AVCB` = X4, `Benzonia ED` = X5, `Benzonia EV` = X6, `Benzonia AVCB` = X7) |> 
  mutate(office = case_when(
    candidate == "Poll Book Totals" ~ "Ballots Cast",
    candidate %in% c("Hill Harper", "Elissa Slotkin", "Justin Amash", "Sherry O'Donnell", "Sandy Pensier", "Mike Rogers") ~ "U.S. Senate",
    candidate %in% c("Callie Barr", "Bob Lorinser", "Jack Bergman") ~ "U.S. House"
  )) |> 
  select(office, everything())

benzie_2024
```
If we wanted to finish the job, the rest is pretty similar, and then we'd make a single row for each precinct.

All things considered, that was pretty easy. But take a look at the second page of results, and you'll see more issues. Many - most? - electronic PDFs aren't so easy to parse. Sometimes you'll need to open the exported CSV file and clean things up before importing into R. Other times you'll be able to do that cleaning in R itself.

Here's the sad truth: THIS IS PRETTY GOOD. It sure beats typing it out. And since many government processes don't change all that much, you can save the code to process subsequent versions of PDFs.
