# Geographic data basics

Up to now, we've been looking at patterns in data for what is more than this, or what's the middle look like. We've calculated metrics like percentages, or looked at how data changes over time.

Another way we can look at the data is geographically. Is there a spatial pattern to our data? Can we learn anything by using distance as a metric? What if we merge non-geographic data into geographic data?

The bad news is that there isn't a One Library To Rule Them All when it comes to geo queries in R. But there's one emerging, called Simple Features, that is very good.

Go to the console and install it with `install.packages("sf")`

To understand geographic queries, you have to get a few things in your head first:

1.  Your query is using planar space. Usually that's some kind of projection of the world. If you're lucky, your data is projected, and the software will handle projection differences under the hood without you knowing anything about it.
2.  Projections are cartographers making opinionated decisions about what the world should look like when you take a spheroid -- the earth isn't perfectly round -- and flatten it. Believe it or not, every state in the US has their own geographic projection. There's dozens upon dozens of them.
3.  Geographic queries work in layers. In most geographic applications, you'll have multiple layers. You'll have a boundary file, and a river file, and a road file, and a flood file and combined together they make the map. But you have to think in layers.
4.  See 1. With layers, they're all joined together by the planar space. So you don't need to join one to the other like we did earlier -- the space has done that. So you can query how many X are within the boundaries on layer Y. And it's the plane that holds them together.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/geolayers.jpg"))
```

## Importing and viewing data

Let's start with the absolute basics of geographic data: loading and viewing. Load libraries as usual.

```{r}
#| output: false
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(janitor)
```

First: an aside on geographic data. There are many formats for geographic data, but data type you'll see the most is called the shapefile. It comes from a company named ERSI, which created the most widely used GIS software in the world. For years, they were the only game in town, really, and the shapefile became ubiquitous, especially so in government and utilities.

So more often than not, you'll be dealing with a shapefile. But a shapefile isn't just a single file -- it's a collection of files that combined make up all the data that allow you to use it. There's a .shp file -- that's the main file that pulls it all together -- but it's important to note if your shapefiles has a .prj file, which indicates that the projection is specified.

You also might be working with a GeoDatabase, or a .gdb file. That's a slightly different, more compact version of a Shapefile.

The data we're going to be working with is a GeoDatabase from the [Prince George's County Department of Planning](https://gisdata.pgplanning.org/opendata/) that contains information about the county's election precincts.

Similar to `readr`, the `sf` library has functions to read geographic data. In this case, we're going to use `st_read` to read in our hospitals data. And then glimpse it to look at the columns.

```{r}
pg_precincts <- st_read("data/Election_Precinct_2022_Py.gdb")

glimpse(pg_precincts)
```

This looks like a normal dataframe, and mostly it is. We have one row per precinct, and each column is some feature of that precinct: the ID, name and more. What sets this data apart from other dataframes we've used is the last column, "Shape", which is of a new data type. It's not a character or a number, it's a "Multipolygon", which is composed of multiple longitude and latitude values. When we plot these on a grid of latitude and longitude, it will draw those shapes on a map.

Let's look at these precincts. We have 356 of them, according to this data.

But where in Prince George's County are these places? We can simply plot them on a longitude-latitude grid using ggplot and geom_sf.

```{r}
pg_precincts |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Each shape is a precinct, with the boundaries plotted according to its degrees of longitude and latitude.

If you know anything about Prince George's, you can kinda pick out the geographic context here. To the west is the District of Columbia, for example. College Park is near the top. But this map is not exactly ideal. It would help to have a state and county map layered underneath of it, to help make sense of the spatial nature of this data.

This is where layering becomes more clear. First, we want to go out and get another shapefile, this one showing Maryland county outlines.

Instead of loading it from our local machine, like we did above, we're going to use a package to directly download it from the U.S. Census. The package is called `tigris` and it's developed by the same person who made `tidycensus`.

In the console, install tigris with `install.packages('tigris')`

Then load it:

```{r}
library(tigris)
```

Now, let's use the counties() function from tigris to pull down a shapefile of all U.S. counties.

```{r}
#| output: false

counties <- counties()

glimpse(counties)
```

This looks pretty similar to our Census blocks shapefile, in that it looked mostly like a normal dataframe with the exception of the new geometry column.

This county shapefile has all 3233 U.S. counties. We only want the Maryland counties, so we're going to filter the data to only keep Maryland counties. There is no STATE column, but there is a STATEFP column, with each number representing a state. Maryland's FP number is 24.

```{r}
md_counties <- counties |>
  filter(STATEFP == "24")

```

To see what this looks like, let's plot it out with ggplot. We can pretty clearly see the shapes of Maryland counties.

```{r}
md_counties |>
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Hey, look, it's Maryland! Of course, we just need Baltimore City, so let's get that:

```{r}
baltimore_city <- md_counties |>
  filter(COUNTYFP == "510")
```

With this county map, we can layer our places data.

Something to note: The layers are rendered in the order they appear. So the first geom_sf is rendered first. The second geom_sf is rendered ON TOP OF the first one.

We're also going to change things up a bit to put the datasets we want to display INSIDE of the geom_sf() function, instead of starting with a dataframe. We have two to plot now, so it's easier this way.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=md_counties |> filter(COUNTYFP == "033")) +
  geom_sf(data=pg_precincts) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Notice the subtle differences at the boundaries?

Let's dive back into Prince George's precincts and see what more we can find out about them. It would be useful to know, for example, what turnout was like for the July primary election. We can use [the state's data](https://elections.maryland.gov/press_room/2022_stats/Official%20by%20Party%20and%20Precinct.csv) to determine this.

```{r}
primary_22 <- read_csv("data/Official by Party and Precinct.csv") |> clean_names()
pg_turnout <- primary_22 |> 
  filter(lbe == "Prince George's") |> 
  group_by(precinct) |> 
  summarise(total_polls = sum(polls), total_early = sum(early_voing), total_absentee = sum(absentee), total_provisional = sum(provisional), total_eligible = sum(eligible_voters))

View(pg_turnout)
```

Now we can join the precincts to the turnout data.

```{r}
pg_precincts_with_turnout <- pg_precincts |> left_join(pg_turnout, by=c("PRECINCT_ID"="precinct"))
```

Now we can use color to distinguish precincts from each other. Let's use the total eligible voters to start with, and we'll use a color scale that will help us see the differences:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=pg_precincts_with_turnout, aes(fill=total_eligible)) +
  scale_colour_viridis_b(option="magma") +
  theme_minimal()
```

With these changes, what else can we make out here? First, you can pretty easily spot our "ghost precincts" - they are the ones in white, where there are no eligible voters. But you also can see that there's some pretty big variation among the number of eligible voters per precinct across the county, with some very large ones in the middle.
